# Extra for try hards :D
If you want to make life harder. 
1. Enable defender when doing the windows attacks
2. Set up an ELK and try not to detect yourself
3. Do everything in memory
4. Run crowdstrike falcon and still do the attacks
5. Auto exploit scripts for complex chains

# Other things
This is going to be changing and evolving till I run out of time / get bored / forget it exists.
Feel free to add a pull request for your own attack paths. (Pls use ansible)
